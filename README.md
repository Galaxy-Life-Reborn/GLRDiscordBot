# GLR Discord Bot
Sort of official GLR bot that interacts with the Galaxy Life Reborn api using [GLR.Net](https://github.com/svr333/GLR.Net) as api wrapper.

## Galaxy Life Reborn
Galaxy Life Reborn is a recreation of Galaxy Life, which got shutdown. You can find more about the project [here](https://galaxylifereborn.com).  
Feel free to join the [Official Galaxy Life Reborn Discord Server](https://discord.gg/UFqyjHJ).

# Invite the bot
## Invite link with all permissions (recommended)
This will avoid any problems regarding bot not being able to see/send in certain channels.

# Installing

You can find a quick explanation on how to deploy yourself [here](https://github.com/svr333/GLR-bot/blob/master/README.md).  
If I ever feel like it, I will add the documentation here or at this repository's wiki.

# Documentation
At some point in the future I will make a wiki attached to this repository for documentation, but for now I don't have the time nor the will to do so.

I'll most likely finish [The Template's Wiki](https://github.com/svr333/AdvancedDiscordBot-Template/wiki) before I start on this one, so take a look there.  
If you have any *reasonable* questions, you can always find me on Discord with tag: svr333#3451
